### Check-in 2
- Components gutted for development
- Icon should have a basic API to render the icon based on having the correct name leveraged
- Header / banner element should have a basic API supporting two named slots and implementing your icon
- Your icon definition should be dynamically imported in the constructor or firstUpdated life-cycle of the header / banner element (reading and examples before should help inform this)
  - It is for the main card.
### Check-in 3
- All elements scoped out and somewhat working
- Functional multi-slot
- Icon as an icon alone
### Check-in 4
- All Elements are working
- We have some fancy graphics now with hidable content.
- We still need to meet some of the requirements with the demos
- Testing is built out and fully covered main component. Need to create tests for other components
- Storybook needs a lot of work.
- Storybook hasn't been started (that I know of)
- Displaying button with demo needs to happen still.
